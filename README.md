# Multi-Agent-Systems
The research area now known as multi-agent systems (MAS) was initially called “distributed AI” (DAI). MAS research is to study systems that consist of a group of agents that can potentially interact with each other. Here is a handful of resources that may be helpful to you at the beginning of your research work in this area. 

## Survey_Future work in multi-agent systems research with probably approaches
My first-day survey on multi-agent systems. I believe all the information in this half-page work comes from several good surveys.  
This work is done in Sept 2021.

## A Tiny Guide for beginners in Multi-Agent Systems Research
This is a very beginning level neither a well-organized nor a well-written short paper.  
This work is done in Nov 2021.

## Reinforcement Learning for Cooperative Multi-Agent Systems_first version
This proposal is my first paperwork in MARL. The quality is not that good...  
This work is done on Nov 20, 2022.
